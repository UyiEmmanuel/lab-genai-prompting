    "Question: As a worker, do my responsibilities change under the OHS Regulations?\n",
    "Response:\"\n",
    "Model Response:\n",
    "Hey there! Don't worry, your responsibilities as a worker won't really change much under the new OHS Regulations. The main thing is that you've always had a responsibility to work safely, and that's still the case. These responsibilities used to be part of the Safety Acts, but now they'll be included in the Regulations as well.\n",
    "Basically, you'll need to continue using all the required safeguards, safety equipment, and personal protective equipment outlined in the Regulations. You'll also need to follow the safe work practices and procedures that are developed based on these new Regulations.\n",
    "So while the rules might be a bit different, the core idea is the same – stay safe, follow the guidelines, and use the proper equipment. As long as you keep doing that, you'll be good to go under the new Regulations!\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "The specificity prompting approach successfully guides the model to generate a response with a friendly and conversational tone, as requested. The response uses informal language, contractions, and a casual style to convey the information in a more approachable manner. The model effectively adapts its response style while still accurately summarizing the relevant information from the FAQ document."

    "Explanation:\n",
    "Iterative refinement prompting involves asking the language model to refine or improve upon its previous response. This approach allows for multiple iterations, where the model can incorporate feedback or additional context to enhance its responses over time.\n",
    "Example Prompt:\n",
    "\"Based on the information in the attached FAQ document, provide a response to the following question:\n",
    "Question: Is there a grace period? How much time do I have to become compliant with the OHS Regulations?\n",
    "Initial Response:\n",
    "There is no grace period once the Regulations become law. You need to be compliant as soon as they are implemented.\n",
    "Feedback: The response is accurate but lacks some important details from the FAQ document. Please refine your response to provide more comprehensive information.\n",
    "Refined Response:\n",
    "[Provide a more detailed and comprehensive response, incorporating the feedback and referring to relevant information from the FAQ document.]\"\n",
    "Model Response:\n",
    "Refined Response: There is no grace period once the OHS Regulations become law. You need to anticipate and prepare now, so when the Regulations come into effect, you will be compliant from the start. The FAQ document emphasizes the importance of being ready to comply as soon as the Regulations are implemented.\n",
    "To ensure compliance, you should review the relevant sections of the Regulations and make any necessary changes to your safety program, training procedures, equipment, and workplace practices. This may include costs for training and education, potential equipment updates like fall protection, allocating time for safety committees, supervisor training, worker training, and developing printed safety procedures.\n",
    "The key is to take proactive steps now to understand the changes and requirements outlined in the Regulations, so you can make the necessary adjustments and be fully compliant when they become law, without any grace period.\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "The iterative refinement prompting approach allows the model to improve upon its initial response by incorporating feedback and additional context from the FAQ document. The refined response provides more comprehensive information, including details about the importance of being prepared, potential costs and steps for compliance, and the need to review and understand the changes in the Regulations. This iterative process helps the model generate a more complete and informative response."
